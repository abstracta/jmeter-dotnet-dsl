### Dummy sampler

In many cases, you want to be able to test part of the test plan but without directly interacting with the service under test, avoiding any potential traffic to the servers, testing some border cases which might be difficult to reproduce with the actual server, and avoid actual server interactions variability and potential unpredictability. In such scenarios, you might replace actual samplers with `DummySampler` (which uses [Dummy Sampler plugin](https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/DummySampler/)) to be able to test extractors, assertions, controllers conditions, and other parts of the test plan under certain conditions/results generated by the samplers.

Here is an example:

```cs
using static Abstracta.JmeterDsl.JmeterDsl;

public class PerformanceTest
{
    [Test]
    public void LoadTest()
    {
        TestPlan(
            ThreadGroup(2, 10,
                // HttpSampler("http://my.service")
                DummySampler("{\"status\" : \"OK\"}")
            )
        ).Run();
    }
}
```

::: tip
The DSL configures dummy samplers by default, in contrast to what JMeter does, with response time simulation disabled. This allows to speed up the debugging process, not having to wait for proper response time simulation (sleeps/waits). If you want a more accurate emulation, you might turn it on through the `ResponseTimeSimulation()` method.
