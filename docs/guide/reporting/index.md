## Reporting

Once you have a test plan you would usually want to be able to analyze the collected information. This section contains a few ways to achieve this, but in the future, we plan to support more ([as Java DSL does](https://abstracta.github.io/jmeter-java-dsl/guide/#reporting)). If you are interested in some not yet covered feature, please ask for it by creating an [issue in the repository](https://github.com/abstracta/jmeter-dotnet-dsl/issues).
