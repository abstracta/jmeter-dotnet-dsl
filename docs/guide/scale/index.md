## Run test at scale

Running a load test from one machine is not always enough, since you are limited to the machine's hardware capabilities. Sometimes, is necessary to run the test using a cluster of machines to be able to generate enough load for the system under test. Currently, the .Net DSL only provides two ways to run tests at scale, but in the future, we plan to support more ([as Java DSL does](https://abstracta.github.io/jmeter-java-dsl/guide/#run-test-at-scale)). If you are interested in some not yet covered feature, please ask for it by creating an [issue in the repository](https://github.com/abstracta/jmeter-dotnet-dsl/issues).
